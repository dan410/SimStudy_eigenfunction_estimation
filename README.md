Simulation Study of Eigenfunction Estimators
============================================

This project is investigates and compares eigenfunction estimators. The main focus is on nonparametric estimator developed in dissertation, but for comparison purposes other standard estimators are considered. Currently the only other estimator considered is one described in, Functional Data Analysis (Ramsay and Silverman), and implemented in the R package `fda`.
